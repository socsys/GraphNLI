If we assume that one party is substantially better than the other, the expected value of voting is [positive](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf), because the costs of having a bad party are very high. Therefore, irrationality is not inherent to the act of voting, and rationality is a valid measure for assessing voter behaviour.',\n",
